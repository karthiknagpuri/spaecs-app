# Security Policy

## ðŸ”’ Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Spaecs platform and provides guidelines for maintaining security best practices.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [Add your security email]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

**Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours and provide a fix within 7 days for critical vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- âœ… Supabase Auth with Google OAuth
- âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all database tables
- âœ… Middleware-based route protection
- âœ… Session management with secure cookies
- âœ… Environment variable validation at startup

### 2. API Security
- âœ… Rate limiting on all payment endpoints (10 requests/minute)
- âœ… CSRF protection using Origin/Referer validation
- âœ… Input validation with Zod schemas
- âœ… Webhook signature verification
- âœ… SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### 3. Payment Security
- âœ… Razorpay signature verification
- âœ… Webhook payload validation
- âœ… Raw body parsing for signature verification
- âœ… Amount validation and limits
- âœ… Sensitive data sanitization in logs

### 4. Data Protection
- âœ… Environment variables for sensitive credentials
- âœ… No credentials in version control
- âœ… Structured logging with PII redaction
- âœ… HTTPS enforcement in production

### 5. Error Handling
- âœ… Graceful error handling with safe defaults
- âœ… No sensitive data in error messages
- âœ… Structured error logging
- âœ… Security event tracking

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never Commit Secrets**
   - Always use `.env.local` for local development
   - Use `.env.example` as a template
   - Check environment variables before committing

2. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate user input using Zod schemas
   - Sanitize data before database operations
   - Use prepared statements for SQL queries

3. **Authentication**
   - Always check user session in protected routes
   - Use Supabase RLS for database-level security
   - Implement proper error handling for auth failures

4. **Logging**
   - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, card numbers)
   - Use the structured logger (`src/lib/logger.ts`)
   - Include security event logging

5. **Dependencies**
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories

### For Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Required production environment variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-production-url>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-production-anon-key>
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>

   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<your-production-key-id>
   RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<your-production-secret>
   RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-webhook-secret>

   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://spaecs.app
   ```

2. **Security Headers**
   Add to `next.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   async headers() {
     return [
       {
         source: '/(.*)',
         headers: [
           {
             key: 'X-Frame-Options',
             value: 'DENY',
           },
           {
             key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
             value: 'nosniff',
           },
           {
             key: 'Referrer-Policy',
             value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
           },
           {
             key: 'Permissions-Policy',
             value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()',
           },
         ],
       },
     ];
   }
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   - Enable RLS on all tables
   - Review and test RLS policies
   - Use service role key only in trusted server contexts
   - Enable database backups

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
   - Monitor rate limit violations
   - Track failed authentication attempts
   - Set up alerts for security events

## Security Checklist
